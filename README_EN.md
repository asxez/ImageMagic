# What is it?
Image Magic is a package of Python that provides concise image (including but not limited to) processing functions, mainly embodied in the word concise.

# What can be done?
1. Image processing
2. OCR function
3. Image hash calculation
4. Commonly used image-related features.
   1. Image classification, is it dominated by tens of thousands of different types of pictures in a folder? If there is, then you can try me.
   2. Only one duplicate picture is retained. In huge folders, you shouldn't manually weed out duplicate images, right?
